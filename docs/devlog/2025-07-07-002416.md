✅ やったこと
Successfully integrated the Google Gemini API into the `commit-ai.ps1` script. This allows for generating commit messages using AI, significantly improving the efficiency and quality of commit descriptions. Added comprehensive documentation for API key retrieval and API usage (`docs/manual/APIKEY_get.md` and `docs/manual/api-dev-flow.md`). Created a new PowerShell script `invoke-gemini-api.ps1` to handle the Gemini API interaction, including error handling and response parsing. Updated `commit-ai.ps1` and `manage-prompt.ps1` to handle both API and local AI modes, controlled by the `use_api_mode` flag in `prompt-config.json`. Added robust error handling for API key retrieval and API calls. The `prompt-config.json` file now includes settings for API usage (API key environment variable, endpoints, and provider). Implemented UTF-8 BOM handling to prevent JSON parsing errors.

📚 学びと発見
Learned how to effectively use the Google Gemini API, including request formatting, error handling, and response parsing. Discovered the importance of proper JSON handling and UTF-8 BOM removal for seamless script execution. Learned how to structure PowerShell scripts for better readability and maintainability using more descriptive comments. The Gemini API's response format required careful parsing to extract the generated text accurately. Experienced issues with UTF-8 BOMs in JSON files, leading to `ConvertFrom-Json` failures. Resolved this by adding a check and trimming the BOM if present.

😌 今の気分
Satisfied. The API integration went smoothly, and the added documentation and error handling make the scripts much more robust and user-friendly. I'm excited about the improved commit message generation workflow!

😠ぼやき
The Gemini API response structure was a bit more complex than initially anticipated, requiring some extra effort in parsing the JSON response to extract the desired output. Debugging the UTF-8 BOM issue in the JSON config file took some time.

❗ 課題・次にやること
Next steps involve expanding the API adapter functionality to support other AI providers (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic). The current error handling is sufficient but could be improved by providing more specific error messages. Consider adding more comprehensive logging for debugging purposes. Explore options for rate limiting and improved API key management. Testing the integration with various prompts and scenarios is necessary to ensure comprehensive functionality.
